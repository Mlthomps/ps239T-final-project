This is a template you can use for your final project. Fill in each section with information on your own project.

## Short Description

The projects aim was to gather and analyze data surrounding former coup d'etat leaders in democratic elections in sub-Saharan Africa. 

The coding aspect of the project was focused on merging the data  for each year on interest (the year of the coup, year of leaders exit, and the year of the election). Therefore, the data was merged multiple times and it was very important to rename variables before margining for the next year unit of interest. The graphs are made in ggplot2, and have many specific alterations. In doing so, the images are clear and more illustrative of the data. 

## Dependencies

1. R, version 3.1

### Data

1. p4v2014.xls: The PolityVI dataset, available here: http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscrdata.html

2. WDI: the world bank information is including in an R package.

* the original raw data is not included in this repo, please email mlthomps@berkeley.edu if you have questions.

### Code 

The entirety of the project was done in R. This code merges the data, performs the analytics, and creates the images.
